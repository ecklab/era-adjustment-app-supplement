# Introduction

We will go through examples of how our Full House Model era-adjusts batting averages (BA) using the parametric method, and bWAR (Baseball-Reference Win Above Replacement), fWAR (Fangraphs Win Above Replacement), HR (Home Run), BB (Walks) for batters, bWAR, fWAR, ERA (Earned Run Average), SO (Strikeout) for pitchers using the nonparametric method. Also we provide details about how the tables and figures in the paper and supplementary materials are produced.

We first load in relevant software packages and the data. The necessary data are collected from [Baseball-Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/), [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/) and Github [Chadwick](https://github.com/chadwickbureau). The details of data collection are in the Supplement Materials. The revelant datasets that involved in this technical report can be found in the [Tech_report_data](https://github.com/yanshenlmx/Tech_report_data)

For batters, each row of data consists of a player ID, a year ID, a name, a age, a league ID (lgID), a recorded number of at bats (AB), game(G), plate appearances (PA), a park-factored batting average (BA), a walk (BB), a observed hits (obs_hits), observed home run (obs_HR), a hit-by-pitch (HBP), a sacrifice bunt (SH), a sacrifice fly (SF), a park-factored hits (H), a park-factored home run (HR), a baseball-reference WAR (bWAR), a fangraph WAR (fWAR) and a size of the talent pool (pops).

For pitchers, each row of data consists of a player ID, a year ID, a name, a age, a league ID (lgID), a team ID (teamID), a recorded number of inning pitched (IP) and a game(G), a observed earned run (obs_ER), a observed home run (obs_HR), a observed hits (obs_H), a strikeout (SO), a park-factored earned run (ER), a park-factored home run (HR_PF), a park-factored hits (H_PF), a walk (BB), a hit-by-pitch (HBP), a baseball-reference WAR (bWAR), a fangraph WAR (fWAR) and a size of the talent pool (pops).

In this analysis we assume that BA $\stackrel{i i d}{\sim} N\left(\mu_{i}, \sigma_{i}\right)$ and that talent scores $\stackrel{i i d}{\sim} \operatorname{Pareto}(\alpha)$ where $\alpha=1.16$. We do not have any assumptions on the distribution of the baseball statistics. This choice of alpha corresponds to the Pareto principle which is casually referred to as the $80 / 20$ rule.

# Batters

In this section, our Full House Model era-adjusts batting statistics, such as bWAR, fWAR, HR, BB and BA using the nonparametric distribution measuring the components. We also apply our Full House Model to  era-adjuste BA using the parametric distribution measuring the components. 

## bWAR

We now try out the bWAR for batters and first we select the full-time batters. We declare the median PA after screening out individuals who batted fewer than 75 PA as our cutoff for full-time batters.

```{r cache=TRUE}
batters <- bat_dat %>% select(yearID, playerID, lgID, name, age, PA, G, bWAR, pops)
cutoff <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(years, mc.cores = ncores, FUN = function(xx){
    m <- batters %>% filter(yearID == xx) %>% filter(PA >= 75)
    data.frame(thres = median(m$PA), yearID = xx)
  }))
batters <- merge(batters, cutoff, by = 'yearID')
batters <- batters %>% mutate(comp =  bWAR / G, full_time = ifelse(PA >= thres, 'Y', 'N'))
```

In the [1994 and 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Major_League_Baseball_strike), hitters and pitchers played fewer games per season than the regular season. To deal with extreme statistics from the small sample size, we motivated a shrinkage method that adjust the raw statistics toward a global average. Our shrinkage method follows a shrinkage of ballpark effect estimates motivated from Michael Schell's book, [Baseball's All-Time Best Sluggers](https://www-jstor-org.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/stable/j.ctt19705ks.25?seq=8). This methods involves weighted average of raw components and league average, which is 

$$\textrm{adjusted component} = (\textrm{raw components} \times \textrm{total ABs} + 4000 \times \textrm{league average})/(\textrm{totals AB + 4000}) $$
When we use the shrinkage method to analyze our seasonal data, the shrinkage factor $4000 / (\textrm{totals AB + 4000})$ get adjusted based on fraction of 4000 to the totals AB of the MLB teams. For example, $$\textrm{adjusted bWAR per game} = (\textrm{raw bWAR per game} \times \textrm{game} + 7 \times \textrm{league average})/(\textrm{game + 7}) $$

```{r cache=TRUE}
batters_schell <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(years, mc.cores = ncores, FUN = function(xx){
    int<- batters %>% filter(yearID == xx)
    lg_avg <- sum(int$bWAR)/sum(int$G)
    int %>% mutate(comp = (bWAR + lg_avg * 7)/(G + 7))
  }))
```

The following script computes the talent scores for bWAR per game from all batters and all seasons (1871 to 2022).

```{r cache=TRUE}
batters_talent_bWAR <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(years, mc.cores = ncores, function(yy){
  talent_computing_nonpara(dataset = batters_schell, component_name = "bWAR", year = yy, ystar = thresh_fun(component = batters_schell %>% filter(full_time == 'Y', yearID == yy) %>% select(comp), component_name = 'bWAR'), alpha = 1.16) })) %>% arrange(-WAR_talent)
```

We built a common mapping environment with regard to the provided season size based on the no-strike seasons rather than utilizing one specific season from 1871 to 2022 as the projected season. To acquire era-adjusted statistics, we project the players' talent to this common mapping environment. [Micheal Schell](https://www-jstor-org.proxy2.library.illinois.edu/stable/j.ctt19705ks.6?seq=15) inspired us to use the National League seasons from 1977 through 1989, with the exception of the 1981 strike season, as the common mapping environment. The number of teams in these seasons that we choose remains constant in order to prevent the Major League's expansion effect. We then construct an isotonic regression model of the corresponding components on the ordered talent scores. In the common mapping environment, this model provides the association between the components and the talent scores.

We set the total number of full-time players throughout all seasons to be equal to the number of components in the common mapping environment. This is due to the fact that the more components in the common mapping environment, the $\widetilde{F}_{Y_i}(t)$ and $F_{Y_i}(t)$ are more closely. Then we select this number of components based on the quantile mapping and the quantiles of the components are equally spaced. The talent scores of the components we choose from the common mapping environment are calculated using the isotonic regression model. Now we construct the common mapping environment completely.

```{r cache=TRUE}
no_strike <- batters_talent_bWAR %>% 
    filter(yearID < 1990, yearID >= 1977, yearID != 1981, 
           full_time == 'Y', lgID == 'NL') %>%
    arrange(WAR_talent)
  
t <- isoreg(no_strike$WAR_talent, no_strike$comp)
talent_new <- quantile(no_strike$WAR_talent, probs = (seq(0,250)/250))
comp_new <- as.stepfun(t)(talent_new)
```

The figure below shows the relationship between bWAR talent and bWAR per game. The black dots represent the observations from the full-time batters from the 1977 season to 1989 season with the exception of the 1981 strike season. The red dots represent the observations from the common mapping environment that we define above. Based on the figure above, the observations from the common mapping environment accurately depict the relationship between bWAR talent and bWAR per game from the 1977 season to the 1989 season with the exception of the 1981 strike season.

```{r}
mapping_envir <- data.frame(talent_new = talent_new, comp_new = comp_new)
ggplot(data = no_strike, aes(x = WAR_talent, y = comp)) + geom_point(shape = 1) + 
  geom_line(data = mapping_envir, aes(x = talent_new, y = comp_new), cex = 1) +
  labs(x = 'bWAR talent', y = 'bWAR per game') +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log')
```

```{r}
ystar <- thresh_fun(comp_new, component_name = 'bWAR')
pop_new <- round(mean(no_strike$pops))
component_name = 'bWAR'
yy <- sort(comp_new)
n <- length(yy)
ytilde <- rep(0, n + 1)
if (component_name == 'bWAR' | component_name == 'fWAR') {
    ytilde[1] <- yy[1] - (yy[2] - yy[1])
}
if (component_name == 'HR' | component_name == 'BB') {
    # since the minimal HR is greater or equal to 0.
    ytilde[1] <- 0
}
ytilde[n+1] <- yy[n] + ystar
ytilde[2:n] <- unlist(lapply(2:n, function(j){
    (yy[j]+yy[j-1])/2 
}))
```

We now extend the method to compute hypothetical careers in the common mapping environment and obtain the era-adjusted statistics.

```{r cache=TRUE}
career_kAB_1st <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(1:30000, function(zz){
    int <- career_talent_nonpara(dataset = batters_talent_bWAR, component_name = 'bWAR', 
                         snippet = batters_talent_bWAR[zz,], alpha = 1.16, 
                         talent_new = talent_new, pop_new = pop_new, ytilde = ytilde)
    int
  }, mc.cores = ncores))
  
  
career_kAB_2nd <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(30001:60000, function(zz){
    int <- career_talent_nonpara(dataset = batters_talent_bWAR, component_name = 'bWAR', 
                         snippet = batters_talent_bWAR[zz,], alpha = 1.16, 
                         talent_new = talent_new, pop_new = pop_new, ytilde = ytilde)
    int
  }, mc.cores = ncores)) 
  
career_kAB_3rd <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(60001:nrow(batters_talent_bWAR), function(zz){
    int <- career_talent_nonpara(dataset = batters_talent_bWAR, component_name = 'bWAR', 
                         snippet = batters_talent_bWAR[zz,], alpha = 1.16, 
                         talent_new = talent_new, pop_new = pop_new, ytilde = ytilde)
    int
  }, mc.cores = ncores)) 
  
career_kAB <- rbind(career_kAB_1st, career_kAB_2nd, career_kAB_3rd)
```

Instead of using the raw G and PA in the data set, we calculate the mapped G by applying quantile mapping for the full-time hitters and non-full-time hitters separately. Quantile mapping is based on that a pth percentile player's games in one year is equal to a pth percentile player's games in the common mapping environment.

We also specify that worst performance of bWAR for the full time players in each season -2.

Then we apply the same techniques for fWAR.

  ytilde <- rep(0, n + 1)
  if (component_name == 'bWAR' | component_name == 'fWAR') {
    ytilde[1] <- yy[1] - (yy[2] - yy[1])
  }
  if (component_name == 'HR' | component_name == 'BB') {

    mutate(mapped_G_fWAR = round(adj_fWAR / adj_comp))
```

We also apply our full house model to BB and HR. Before we do that, we get lower bounds on walk rate and home run rate. We isolate players with batting records from the common mapping environment and restrict attention to players with 10 years of batting records. Then we obtain the 0.03rd quantile of walk rate and home run rate for the these players for seasons in which they obtained at least 400 PAs and serve the quantiles as minimum allowable rates in the common mapping environment.

[Stephen Jay Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House:_The_Spread_of_Excellence_from_Plato_to_Darwin) suggests that the BA in every season follows normal distribution and we perform Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test to verify this argument. Based on the results, 16 out of 152 seasons from 1971 to 2022 seasons fail the normality test. The 16 seasons are 1876, 1895, 1896, 1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1922, 1924, 1941, 1946, 1959, 1961, 1967, 1972, 1987, 1994, 1997. 

```{r cache=TRUE}
batters <- bat_dat
  
  batters <- merge(batters, cutoff, by = 'yearID')
  
  batters <- batters %>% select(playerID, yearID, lgID, name, age, lgID, AB, 
                                PA, obs_hits, H, thres, bWAR, pops) %>%
    mutate(comp = ifelse(AB != 0, H / AB, 0), full_time = ifelse(PA >= thres, 'Y', 'N'))
  
  batters_schell <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(years, mc.cores = ncores, FUN = function(xx){
    int<- batters %>% filter(yearID == xx)
    lg_avg <- sum(int$H)/sum(int$AB)
    int %>% mutate(comp = (H + lg_avg * 25)/(AB + 25))
  }))
  
  normality <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(years, mc.cores = ncores, FUN = function(xx){
    m <- batters_schell %>% filter(yearID == xx, full_time == 'Y') %>% pull(comp) %>% shapiro.test()
    data.frame(yearID = xx, p_value = m$p.value)
  }))
  
  years[which(normality$p_value <= 0.05)]
```

We eliminate players who had an era-adjusted bWAR or fWAR below the replacement level for more than half of their career seasons. We also set three rules to eliminate some players' poor early and late career seasons. The three rules are 

+ In at least 2 consecutive seasons, the era-adjusted bWAR is below -1.5.
+ In at least 2 consecutive seasons, the era-adjusted fWAR is below -1.5. 
+ In at least two consecutive seasons, no more than one era-adjusted bWAR or era-adjusted fWAR can be more than 0.2. 

The value 0.2 is calculated from the average bWAR or fWAR of the players that disappeared from the MLB from the 1977 season to 1989 season with the exception of 1981 season. 

After getting the era-adjusted statistics, we find some players' statistics dramatically change in tails of their career, which is unrealistic in the real life. To solve it, we apply some smoothing methods to alleviate these dramatic variations, such as local polynomial regression fitting and natural cubic spline. Then natural cubic spline method has the minimal bias and is considered as the best option compared with other methods.

Also, we notice that the smoothing method could weaken player's prime or extreme seasons. Therefore, we take the average of the smoothed era-adjusted statistics and era-adjusted statistics, which can keep player's prime season and alleviate the dramatic changes in the tail of their career.

## Year Effect on the Talent of the Replacement-level Batters

The year effect for bWAR from the talent perspective and the era-adjusted bWAR perspective will be covered in this section. 

The two figures below show that the bWAR and fWAR talent of the replacement-level batters from 1871 to 2023 The line in the plot is the smoothed line after apply natural cubic spline method. The changing pattern is the similar for the talent of the replacement-level batters and talent pool. The seasons that deviate from the smoothed line are those associated with strikes and World War II, such as 1943 - 1946, 1981, 1994, 1995 and 2020 seasons.

The figure above shows the era-adjusted bWAR values over time corresponding to a hypothetical batter with 0 bWAR in 2023 using the Full House Model. The fall in the mid-2000s corresponds to increase of talent pool. Despite the sharp decline in era-adjusted bWAR values in 1981 season, it is untrue that the 1981 batters with 0 bWAR would perform better than the 2023 batters. This is because the 1981 season was brief and a large number of batters underperformed replacement-level players. The problem of the sharp decline in era-adjusted bWAR values in the 1981 season is resolved when we look at the era-adjusted bWAR and era-adjusted bWAR per game of the hypothetical hitters from 2023 with 2 bWAR. 

The two figures below shows the era-adjusted bWAR and era-adjusted bWAR per game of the hypothetical hitters from 2023 with 2 bWAR.

## Expansion Effect 

It is actually supposed that the Major League's expansion effect has a significant impact on how the talent scores vary over time and the magnitude of talent will be diluted with the expansion. However, after adding some hypothetical players who had poor performance in the early seasons, when there were fewer players, we discover that the real players did not much benefit from the adjustment of adding hypothetical players. Additionally, we make an effort to establish replacement player baselines throughout all seasons and adjust these baselines at the same level. However, the baselines we construct for every season are quite similar, and the talents of the players from earlier eras do not get much improved. 

We also perform several simulations to examine the effect of season size. Using the same talent-generating process, we randomly generate different numbers of components from the same distribution and compare the top 1 talent score, top 50 talent scores, top 100 talent scores and top 300 talent scores. In each simulation, we generate two groups of components from the standard normal distribution, one consists 600 components and the other consists 300 components. Then we record the number of largest talents that group 1 is larger than the group 2. We run this simulation 1000 times and diplay the distribution of the result from each simulation. These graphs below show that top talent scores for various amounts of components from the same distribution are identical.

```

We also run another simulation to test the effect of season size. Instead of generating 600 components in the group 1, I generate 900 components and repeat the rest of the simulation. Then we have the similar results.

hist(m_50, main = 'compare the largest 50 talents')
hist(m_100, main = 'compare the largest 100 talents')

In this part, we compare the BA before and in the expansion seasons and see if there is a significant difference between them. The expansion seasons are collected from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) and they are 1879, 1892, 1900, 1901, 1961, 1962, 1969, 1977, 1993, and 1998. We compute the average and standard deviation of full-time batters' BA before and in the expansion seasons and the results are shown below. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
#library(Lahman)
#foo <- Batting %>% filter(yearID %in% c(1997, 1998)) %>%
#  filter(AB >= 324) %>%
#  mutate(BA = H/AB) %>%
#  dplyr::select(yearID, playerID, BA, AB)
#foo %>% group_by(yearID) %>%
#  summarise(mBA = mean(BA), sdBA = sd(BA))

batters <- bat_dat
batters <- merge(batters, cutoff, by = 'yearID')
batters <- batters %>% select(playerID, yearID, name, AB, PA, H, thres) %>%
  mutate(comp = ifelse(AB != 0, H / AB, 0), full_time = ifelse(PA >= thres, 'Y', 'N'))
batters_schell <- do.call(rbind, mclapply(years, mc.cores = ncores, FUN = function(xx){
    int<- batters %>% filter(yearID == xx)
    lg_avg <- sum(int$H)/sum(int$AB)
    int %>% mutate(comp = (H + lg_avg * 25)/(AB + 25))
  }))
batters_avg_sd <- batters_schell %>% filter(full_time == 'Y') %>% group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(mean = round(mean(comp),3), sd = round(sd(comp),3))

before_yearID <- c(1878, 1891, 1899, 1900, 1960, 1961, 1968, 1976, 1992, 1997)
after_yearID <- before_yearID + 1
batters_avg_sd_before <- batters_avg_sd %>% filter(yearID %in% before_yearID)
batters_avg_sd_after <- batters_avg_sd %>% filter(yearID %in% after_yearID)

knitr::kable(cbind(batters_avg_sd_before, batters_avg_sd_after)) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

The average and standard error of the difference between the full-time batters' BA before and in the expansion seasons are shown below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(data.frame(avg = mean(batters_avg_sd_before$mean - batters_avg_sd_after$mean), 
                        se = sd(batters_avg_sd_before$mean - batters_avg_sd_after$mean)/(sqrt(10)))) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```


We also show Willie Mays's seasonal bWAR per game in his 22 years MLB career from 1951 to 1973 season except the 1953 season. The red dots represent the seasons that the MLB were experiencing the expansion. The result show that the expansion did not have any significant positive or negative effects on Willie Mays's prime season or the tail of his career. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
willie_mays <- batters_talent_bWAR %>% filter(playerID == 'mayswi01')

```

We also show Randy Johnson's seasonal bWAR per game in his 22 years MLB career from 1988 to 2009 season. The red dots represent the seasons that the MLB were experiencing the expansion. The result show that the expansion did not have any significant positive or negative effects on Randy Johnson's prime season.

## talent pool Calculation

Based on the talent pool computed from the [supplementary materials](./MLBeligiblepop.html), we are able to obtain the proportion of the talent pool before 1950 in different season spans. For example, we would like to calculate the proportion of the talent pool before 1950 from 1871 to 2006. Given the talent pool are evenly distribution from the age 20 to 29, the cumulative MLB-eligible males aged 20 to 29 from 1871 to 1879 is equal to 90% of the talent pool in 1871. Similarly, the cumulative MLB-eligible males aged 20 to 29 from 2000 to 2006 is equal to 60% of the talent pool in 2006. The code below shows how to compute the proportion of the talent pool before 1950 from 1871 to 2006.

```{r echo=TRUE}
MLBpops <- bat_dat %>% group_by(yearID) %>% summarise(pops = unique(pops)) %>% group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(population = round(mean(pops), 2))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
# MLBpops contains the talent pool from 1871 to 2006
n <- MLBpops[MLBpops$yearID %in% c(1871, seq(1880, 2000, 10), 2006),]
p <- n
p$population[1] <- n$population[1] /10*9
p$population[15] <- n$population[15] /10*6
o <- p %>% mutate(population = round(population, 2)) %>% 
  mutate(cpp = round(cumsum(p$population)/(sum(p$population)), 3))

kable(o[o$yearID == 1950,c(1,3)]) %>%

## Sensitivity Analysis for the condition where some talented potential baseball players fail to start their sports career in baseball. 

In this section, we perform a sensitivity analysis for the condition where some talented potential baseball players fail to start their sports career in baseball. For example, people argue that Kyler Murray and Pat Mahomes are playing in the NFL, but they are also considered as the two of the most talented potential baseball players. Competition from other sports is fierce at the upper end of the talent pool where multiple sport opportunities are common. 

In this sensitivity analysis, we assume the 10th, 20th, ..., 100th talented potential baseball players fail to start their sports career in baseball, which indicates the player with 10th largest bWAR or fWAR is paired with 11th largest talent, the player with 20th largest bWAR or fWAR is paired with 22th largest talent, and so on. Then we mapped their talents into the common mapping environment we build before and compute the era-adjusted bWAR and fWAR. We perform this analysis for the seasons after 1950 season based on the effect of baseball integration. We also perform this analysis for the seasons after 1994 season based on the effect of MLB strike.

## Sensitivity analysis for upper bound increment $Y^{**}$

In this part, we perform a sensitivity analysis for the upper bound increment $Y^{**}$ and test how the $Y^{**}$ affects the talent scores and the era-adjusted career statistics. We will illustrate this sensitivity analysis using Babe Ruth as an example. We observe that Babe Ruth was the bWAR, fWAR, HR and BA leaders from the late 1910s to the early 1930s. Then we test how the $Y^{**}$ affects the talent scores by using different $Y^{**}$ for the seasons that Babe Ruth leaded the league, and we compare the new era-adjusted career statistics with the original one. We use four different $Y^{**}$, which are $2*Y^{**}$, $3*Y^{**}$, $Y^{**}/2$, and $Y^{**}/3$.

## Multiverse Analysis

### Batting Average

We will test four factors in our Full House Model and use batting average to illustrate it. These four factors are park-factor effect, population change, component distribution, and season size effect. The table shows the value of the era-adjusted BA of Tony Gwynn in the 1997 season minus the era-adjusted BA of Ty Cobb in the 1911 season under different configurations. The PF column indicates whether we apply the park-factor adjustment to the BA. The YES indicates we apply park-factor adjustment, and NO indicates we did not. The pops column indicates the population changes we apply to the talent pool. The 0.5_favor shows we consider 50\% favorite sport, which is the talent pool we use; The 0.75_favor shows we consider 75\% favorite sport; The 1_favor shows we consider 100\% favorite; The constant shows we assume the talent pool did not change over time and we set it to 1 million; The erosion shows we consider minor league erosion. The details about the how we estimate the talent pool can be found in the [tech report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/MLBeligiblepop.html). The para column indicates we use parametric distribution or non-parametric distribution to measure the BA in each season. The para indicates we use parametric distribution to measure BA and nonpara indicates we use non-parametric distribution to measure BA. The league column indicates we consider two different league sizes as the number of components in each season. The Historical shows we use historical league size as the number of components in each season. The Fixed shows that we compute the maximum number of components in every season and consider this value as the fixed number of components each season. The diff column shows the value of the era-adjusted BA of Tony Gwynn in the 1997 season minus the BA of Ty Cobb in the 1911 season

### bWAR

We also use bWAR to test the effect of population change, season size and trimming method in our Full House Model. The table shows the value of the career bWAR of Willie Mays minus the career bWAR of Babe Ruth under different configurations before and after applying the trimming method. The pops column indicates the population changes we apply to the talent pool. The 0.5_favor shows we consider 50\% favorite sport, which is the talent pool we use; The 0.75_favor shows we consider 75\% favorite sport; The 1_favor shows we consider 100\% favorite; The constant shows we assume the talent pool did not change over time and we set it to 1 million; The erosion shows we consider minor league erosion. The details about the how we estimate the talent pool can be found in the [tech report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/MLBeligiblepop.html). The league column indicates we consider two different league sizes as the number of components in each season. The historical shows we use historical league size as the number of components in each season. The fixed shows that we compute the maximum number of components in every season and consider this value as the fixed number of components each season. The diff_after indicates the value of the career bWAR of Willie Mays minus the career bWAR of Babe Ruth under different configurations after applying the trimming method. The diff_before indicates the value of the career bWAR of Willie Mays minus the career bWAR of Babe Ruth under different configurations before applying the trimming method. We also perform a multiverse analysis for bWAR of Mike Trout in 2012 and 2014. The diff indicates the era-adjusted bWAR of Mike Trout in 2012 minus the era-adjusted bWAR of Mike Trout in 2014 under different configurations without applying the trimming method.

## Multiverse Analysis: Home Run

We will test three factors in our Full House Model and use home run to illustrate it. These four factors are park-factor effect, population change, and season size effect. The table shows the value of the era-adjusted HR of Barry Bonds in the 2001 season minus the era-adjusted HR of Babe Ruth in the 1920 season under different configurations. The PF column indicates whether we apply the park-factor adjustment to the HR. The YES indicates we apply park-factor adjustment, and NO indicates we did not. The pops column indicates the population changes we apply to the talent pool. The 0.5_favor shows we consider 50\% favorite sport, which is the talent pool we use; The 0.75_favor shows we consider 75\% favorite sport; The 1_favor shows we consider 100\% favorite; The constant shows we assume the talent pool did not change over time and we set it to 1 million; The erosion shows we consider minor league erosion. The details about the how we estimate the talent pool can be found in the [tech report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/MLBeligiblepop.html). The league column indicates we consider two different league sizes as the number of components in each season. The Historical shows we use historical league size as the number of components in each season. The Fixed shows that we compute the maximum number of components in every season and consider this value as the fixed number of components each season. The diff column shows the value of the era-adjusted HR of Barry Bonds in the 2001 season minus the era-adjusted HR of Babe Ruth in the 1920 season.

The table below shows the top 25 bWAR players using four different talent generating process. The talent follows folded normal distribution, normal distribution, Pareto distribution with $\alpha = 3$ and Pareto distribution with $\alpha = 1.16$. Given that the ranking lists produced by the four separate generating processes are identical, we can say that our Full House model's talent generating process is fairly robust.
