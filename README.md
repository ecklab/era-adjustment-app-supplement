# Supplemental materials for the era-adjusted baseball statistics website/app 

Era-adjustment is made via [Full House Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11332). This model computes era-adjusted statistics through a principled balancing of how well a player performed "vs their peers" and the size of the MLB eligible population.

## Version 2.0 (full details coming soon)

We present a new version of the Full House Model with:- a new and better justified [MLB eligible population calculation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/MLBeligiblepop.html)- an improved methodology for evaluating careers- data through the 2022 season- removal of rotation adjustments


## Version 1.0 (consistent with [website](https://eckeraadjustment.web.illinois.edu/))


The app contains several era-adjusted statistics for baseball players which are obtained from the Full House Model. This model computes era-adjusted statistics through a principled balancing of how well a player performed "vs their peers" and the size of the MLB eligible population. Under this model, great all-time statistics requires that an MLB player is both better than their peers and played during a time in which the MLB eligible population is large. In this way, the model constructs an even playing field that extends across eras.

For a fun read on the Full House Model see our three-part series: [article I](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/article_I.html), [article II](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/article_II.html), [article III](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/article_III.html)
