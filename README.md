## Version 1.0


The app contains several era-adjusted statistics for baseball players which are obtained from the Full House Model. This model computes era-adjusted statistics through a principled balancing of how well a player performed "vs their peers" and the size of the MLB eligible population. Under this model, great all-time statistics requires that an MLB player is both better than their peers and played during a time in which the MLB eligible population is large. In this way, the model constructs an even playing field that extends across eras.
