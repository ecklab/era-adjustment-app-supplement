# Supplemental materials for our era-adjusted baseball statistics [website](https://eckeraadjustment.web.illinois.edu/)

Era adjustment is made via [Full House Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11332v2). This model computes era-adjusted statistics through a principled balancing of how well a player performed "vs their peers" and the size of the MLB talent pool.

## Version 2.1 (consistent with [website](https://eckeraadjustment.web.illinois.edu/))

We present an updated version of the website with:

- Data through 2024 season
- Better UI on mobile devices

## Version 2.0 (consistent with [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11332v2))

We present a new version of the Full House Model with:- A new and better justified [estimation of the talent pool over time](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/MLBeligiblepop.html)
- A new [detailed writeup](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/era_adjusted_V2_I.html) that highlights some results and discussions based on our era-adjusted statistics.
- A new [technical report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/tech-reports/tech-report-2023.html) that goes through important calculations and additional analyses- Data through the 2023 season- Removed rotation adjustments
- Removed smoothing


## Version 1.0

The app contains several era-adjusted statistics for baseball players which are obtained from the Full House Model. This model computes era-adjusted statistics through a principled balancing of how well a player performed "vs their peers" and the size of the MLB eligible population. Under this model, great all-time statistics requires that an MLB player is both better than their peers and played during a time in which the MLB eligible population is large. In this way, the model constructs an even playing field that extends across eras.

For a fun read on the Full House Model see our three-part series: [article I](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/article_I.html), [article II](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/article_II.html), [article III](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ecklab/era-adjustment-app-supplement/blob/main/writeups/article_III.html)
